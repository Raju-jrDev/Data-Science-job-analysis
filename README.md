# 1. Introduction 

### Problem statement 

Data science has been a domain of continuous evolution and sophistication over the last fourteen years. In 2020, Emily Robinson and Jacqueline Nolis conducted research to show that inconsistent training and job expectations are an effect of the lack of standardization in skill requirements, making it very hard for employers to track people with the required skills. Very often, new data scientists also find it hard to meet the various requirements set by employers. Due to these challenges, many training programs were developed, but their content and quality are very varied. Other studies done in other regions like the US and East Africa also agree with these findings, showing the mismatch between what training is provided and what is needed in the labor market. However, there is also a mismatch between employee expectations of the data science profession and the media hype. This leads to employees applying for jobs that fulfill these expectations but do not require the skills of the applicant. At the same time, the applicants do not want to work for less than they have been promised in the media.  

In the meantime, several research papers have attempted to provide an overview of the skills required for different job titles in data science. This offers several benefits to the employee, who saves costs in the recruitment process by having standardized and accurate job titles and descriptions to attract the right candidates. On the other hand, it provides a guide for educational institutions to ensure standardized data science training. 

However, this research faces the challenge that there is a wide variation in data science skills by industry, labor market, specialization and year. Accordingly, this research cannot provide an up-to-date state of the required labor market skills in the data science recruitment strongest country: USA. Accordingly, our research addresses this gap. 

## Literature review 

First, Emily Robinson and Jaqueline Nolis have investigated the data science labor market in 2020 and written a comprehensive book about professional profile. Using a multi-method approach involving qualitative research and extensive literature review, they have summarized deep insights into the data science job market spanning a period of around 10 years. Following that, the data scientist job popped up in 2010. The media hype surrounding the data science job transformed it to a widespread job trend, shaping what was once a niche market into a job that is integrated across companies and is experiencing a boom in 2020. (Alibasic et al., 2022) The authors determined this primarily to the fact that the title “data scientist” increasingly addresses what was previously only a sub description of a “computer scientist” job posting, but also to the increasing training methods such as boot camps, newly established shortened data science degree programs at universities or online courses that respond to the new trend. At the same time, these accessible and fast training offers also allow many data science newcomers to change careers quickly, easily and cost-effectively. However, the lack of a uniform, clear definition of the skills of a data scientist leads to inconsistent training with a lack of quality standards. Each online certificate and university program has different content and specializations that it deems particularly relevant to data science. While some data scientists specialize in statistics/mathematics, others in data/computer science and others in industry-specific data analysis and visualization of, for example, economics/businessAt the same time, this leads to conflicting expectations between new data scientists entering the market and expecting to be able to apply what they have learned, and companies' expectations of their skills, which are just as varied. Many people apply for a data science position because they have a certain expectation and desire for this position that ultimately cannot be fulfilled as companies have different aspirations which cannot be satisfied with their training. This results in the paradox that the market is flooded with new data scientists, yet there is a shortage of data scientists to cover all the specific needs of companies. (Xiao et al., 2023) The industry expert interviewed by Emily Robinson and Jaqueline Nolis also reiterated this insight by answering the following question. “What skills do you need to be a data scientist?” (Nolis & Robinson, 2020, pp.15) he replied:” If you know R or Python and a little bit of SQL, you're already in a pretty good position to get into data science. It's more important to have a love for learning.”. (Nolis & Robinson, 2020, pp.15) As you can't prepare for the job due to the lack of quality standards, it is important in this field to be open and willing to teach yourself new skills quickly. (Nolis & Robinson, 2020) 

  

To summarize, the data science media hype and labor trend has led to various training opportunities for data analysts and data scientists with, however, no standardized benchmark. This leads to a lack of data scientists who meet the varying expectations of companies and a surplus of data scientists who cannot contribute to the labor market according to their expectations. This raises the question of which skill sets are currently needed on the market by industry and job specialization in order to be able to create a uniform set of expectations for employees and employers. Furthermore, this research was carried out in 2020 and is therefore no longer topical. This raises the question of whether the skills gap has now been closed by the new entrants in 2020, who have adapted to the company's expectations and familiarize themselves with the required content, or whether new knowledge gaps have opened up in the rapidly evolving world of data work. 

 

Addis Ababa also asked himself these questions as part of his labor market analysis for East Africa in 2024. The aim of the study was to create a standardized set of skill expectations for the various data science professional roles in order to generate comprehensible and uniform definitions of the professional role. This involved clustering job postings from various online websites, searching for and listing repeatedly occurring skills of a data related job. In particular, data analysts and data scientists were often associated with the ability to create big data frameworks and database environments and to perform statistical and visual analyses in various programming languages and tools. Soft skills were deemed less relevant. As a consequence, a clear mapping of skills to a job title not only helps applicants to find a suitable job that meets their expectations but also helps companies to target and filter applicants with the right job descriptions and keywords. (Ababa, 2024) 

 

To sum up, it was discussed that it is a challenge for companies to filter out the right applicants from the various data scientist qualifications available. This is due to the fact that the job title is not bound to a specific skills description. This results in a lot of time spent filtering out the appropriate applicants. However, this can be avoided by using standardized skills for job titles. In this research, an attempt was made to describe these skills. The question that arises, however, is whether this skills analysis can also be transferred to other job markets? 

 

A 2022 research on the employability of a data scientist also found a mismatch between applicants' data science skills and employers' expectations, after which data was collected through data scraping for US job postings. Supplemental analysis searched the data for keywords that came up repeatedly to determine which skills were in high demand. The three most frequently occurring hard skills were big data, data processing and artificial intelligence and the three most frequently occurring soft skills were problem solving, teamwork and communication skills. Thereby it was emphasized that this kind of research of expected skills in data related jobs is not only helpful for companies and applicants, but also for the education sector. Universities and other data science training programs should consider such skill sets as a guideline for program planning and secondary education can also increasingly promote soft skills in particular, which are becoming increasingly relevant in a data-driven and technologized world. This results from the fact that soft skills will ultimately be what differentiates from what is done automatically by fast machines. (Ippolito et al., 2022). 

 

In conclusion, this research analyzes the expected data science skills based on US job postings. By analyzing the skills that are most commonly demanded, the research aims to enable institutions to introduce the learners to the hard and soft skills that are relevant in a data driven market. The differences in the skill set expected in data related jobs in Africa and in the USA are an indicator that skill expectations differ in different data related job markets. The researchers also pointed out that these skills are not constant, but can vary by year, which is why skills monitoring is recommended. However, there is a research gap in the skills analysis of data scientists and analysts in 2024. 

Moreover, a literature review was conducted in 2018 (Radovilsky et al., 2018) comparing the skills of business data analytics and data science. This literature-based research found that the expected skills of data scientists and business analysts vary not only by year but also by industry. In business data analytics, more skills were expected in the areas of database design, database management, problem solving and communication, while in data science skills were required such as to be sufficient in different programming languages and analytical methods. (Radovilsky et al., 2018) Other quantitative studies (Costa and Santos, 2017; Meyer, 2019) such as in the healthcare industry from 2019 (Meyer, 2019) came to similar conclusions, in which data visualization with tableau, data analysis with python and r as well as database management with sql were the primary skills required of a healthcare data scientist and analyst. (Meyer, 2019) 

 

In brief, the skills required also differ in different industries. However, there is no current research or comprehensive overview on every industry-specific data science skill. 

Another aspect of the expectation horizon for the data science job is Agoeng's research in 2024. The author used correlation analysis to investigate the relationship between salary level and different related variables, such as experience level, job title, employment type, etc. The dataset they used covered the period from 2020 to 2022 from different countries/regions around the world. They ended up with the conclusion that employees tended to work in the same countries/regions as they lived, and more employees preferred remote work than in the past. (Agoeng, et al., 2024) 

 

In this context, it was recognized that one reason for the mismatch of labor market skill could also be the working conditions. Due to the new hype surrounding the data science job and the emphasis on the relevance of this new job area, high salary expectations are being set. At the same time, data science is considered a very modern job, which means that the data science job also expects flexibility and remote work. However, these are usually only met by large tech companies with very high technical knowledge requirements for the data scientist. Accordingly, many newcomers apply for a data science job with a salary and remote work option, which, however, expects a completely different skill set than previously learned. At the same time, the companies that need the applicant's skills may not be able to make the job attractive enough to attract them. However, because this research data was collected around the world, there might be sampling bias during the data collection in different countries/regions. Moreover, the trend in the later years needs future research to investigate. Thus, the research of the current salary and remote work situation in the data science job market is also intended to give applicants with a salary and remuneration overview an up-to-date insight into data science so that expectations can be adjusted accordingly and the mismatches reduced. (Quan and Raheem, 2023; Agoeng, et al., 2024) 

 

All in all, it is of great importance for companies, employees and educational institutions to examine the skill expectations for different data-related occupations in different industries. It will also investigate whether this range of expectations still differs from the actual skills on the labor market or whether the gap has narrowed since 2020. The research also refers to data from the US, as this is the country with the strongest recruitment for jobs in data science and analytics. 

 

## Conceptual framework 

In particular, the following research questions should be answered. These were developed based on the previous section on research: 

What are the types of data scientist positions for which U.S. organizations of different industries are hiring and what is the focus of the work? 

What job qualifications and skills are required for data scientist positions in U.S. organizations based on different industries? 

How do U.S. data scientist job qualifications and skills vary by job specialization and entry level? 

How does and will the salary and remote ratio behave in relation to job title, industry and entry level? 

 

If the imbalance between required and available qualifications on the market described above still existed, wages would at least behave like one of the following statements according to the neoclassical labour market, as this corresponds to the wage adjustment of the jobs in demand described above: 

The starting salary for entry level jobs has decreased since 2020 because investments have been made in further training programs to correct and compensate for the imbalance in skill levels on the labor market 

The starting salary for higher positions is very high, as employees with a special skill set are in demand 

The salary variance in higher positions is very high, as there are too few highly qualified employees who are tempted to be poached with higher salaries 

There are more job postings in higher positions than in entry-level jobs 

 

## Methodology Structure 

The study will adopt both inductive and deductive approaches to analyze skill sets by industry and salary trends in the data science field. Quantitative approaches have been adopted in this research due to their preciseness, scalability, and reproducibility. The quantitative data obtained from Kaggle included one dataset on salary trends flowing from 2020-2024 and another related to job postings. Even though the research adopted the convenience sampling method, which has some limitations regarding generalizability, the dataset is well-maintained and does not require extra cleaning. 

 

Quantitative data analysis will be done using descriptive statistics: mean, median, and standard deviation, which allow for an understanding of the different compensation trends. Box plots and histograms are further visual methods to be used in the identification of distribution and outliers in the data. Factors of variation of salary will be indicated through comparison and correlation analyses. Regression and time-series analysis will go further in exploring salary predictions and changes over time, with a specific focus on US data from the dataset. In addition, frequency analysis and clustering are used to identify trends and patterns and to create an overview of the various variables and attributes of the current data science job market 

 

## Research design 

The following section explains how the hypotheses and research questions outlined above can be scientifically answered. On the one hand, the skill sets by data science job and by industry are investigated using an inductive research approach. On the other hand, the salary is analyzed using a deductive research approach in order to prove/disprove the hypotheses. Both research approaches are based on quantitative findings, which have the advantage that they can be applied to the general population and are objective. Quantitative research is particularly recommended for the deductive research approach, as it is precise, replicable and scalable. (Creswell and Creswell, 2018) This approach has also been used in previous research. (Ababa, 2024 and Ippolito et al., 2022) 

 

Nevertheless, it can be argued that qualitative research is well suited to business/HR topics (Bryman and Bell, 2007) and would provide even deeper insights into the assessment of phenomena, problems, developments over time and their causes (Ghauri et al., 1995). This research method has also been used in one of the previous research. (Nolis & Robinson, 2020) 

 

To pursue our research goals, however, we will limit ourselves to quantitative research because it is a research approach that has been utilized by most of the previous research and has advantages such as generalization, replicability, scalability and precision. 

 

## Data collection and data set 

The data sets were obtained from the freely available data source “Kaggle”. The two different data set types are divided according to the deductive and inductive research. The deductive research corresponds to the dataset that covers the salary development of 2020-2024 in different countries and the other datasets the job postings from 2020-2024 in the USA. Both data points were initially obtained via web scraping and uploaded as well as updated on “Kaggle”. In that regard, we chose the data sets based on convenience sampling. The dataset are Excel CSV files, which are well-formed tables that require no data cleaning. In total, we have a dataset including 3756  rows for the salary dataset and a job posting data set including over 5000 rows for the job posting. Each row represents a unique sample individual. Further, the datasets included columns, which are “work_year”, “experience_level”, “employment_type”, “job_title”, “salary”, “salry_currency”, “salary_in_use”, “enployee_residence”, “remote_rate”, “company_location”, “job_description”, “industry”, “company_name”  and ‘company_size’. Since we are analyzing salaries in data science only in the US and not globally, the dataset is filtered to only the rows with “US” in the “company_location” column, which will be used for future analysis in this project.  We also pulled the job_posting data from 2024 from Kaggel. We filtered both LinkedIn, Indeed and Glassdoort data with the relevant Job_posting columns and Job_Desc columns for jobs in the United States. In the end, we had 18698 data points from Job posting 

 

## Data analysis methods  

All analyses are solved and displayed using various Python packages. 

To identify patterns, disparities, and trends in employee compensation, descriptive statistics will be conducted by doing summary statistics and distribution analysis. As part of summary statistics, mean, median, minimum, maximum and standard deviation of salaries will be calculated to provide an overview of compensation. Then box plot and histograms will be used to visualize the data distributions and identify outliers.  

 

After completing exploratory data analysis, comparative analysis is utilized to gain more insights on compensation. This can be done by comparing salaries for different job titles, experience level, remote ratio, employment type and company size. To assess the relationship between salary and various attributes such as experience level and remote work correlation analysis will be conducted as the next step of analysis. The main goal of this step is to determine the factors that correlate with higher pay. 

 

Furthermore, the frequency analysis will be conducted to understand the distribution of skills and salary related variables in the salaries and job postings dataset. For the job posting data set in particular, natural language processing is used to filter frequently occurring words and their synonyms. Additionally, frequency analysis will be conducted on cities, companies and industries that have the highest data related job posting. For the salary dataset, the frequency of experience level, employment type, job title, and company location is taken into account. These can then be used to create rankings that help to visualize and understand common trends and give a better overview of the most common patterns in the data science job market. 

 

## Reliability 

According to Creswell and Creswell (2018), a reliability test must be carried out in quantitative research in order to ensure that the results of the research are qualitative and repeatable. Cronbach's alpha should be used as a key metric to determine and prove internal reliability. If the metric is 0.8 or more, this is a sign of a sufficient degree of reliability. The internal reliability of the data can be tested and determined on a random sample of the data.  (Creswell and Creswell, 2018) 

  

Nosek and Bar-Anan (2012) refer here above all to transparency in order to ensure the reproducibility of quantitative evaluations. To enable this, thorough documentation of all steps is recommended in order to outline the methodology. The publication of data is also mentioned in order to ensure the verifiability and reproducibility of unbiased third parties. Documentation in the form of a research report is guaranteed as well as the publication of this to the University of Calgary. In addition, as the data sets are publicly accessible, the evaluation and results can also be reviewed and replicated by others. (Nosek and Bar-Anan, 2012) 

 

## Validity 

Nevertheless, Cook and Campbell (1979) argue that validity is a crucial measure to ensure that the chosen datasets are relevant to the research objectives. Content validity is determined by an industry expert validation. (Cook and Campbell, 1979) 

 

This expert evaluates the data according to its significance for the research objectives, but could not yet be consulted due to the short research span. In the case of criterion validity and construct validity, the research objectives and methodology are compared with research standards and previously conducted related research. On this basis, it was demonstrated that the same methodology was used in previous research by Addis Ababa in 2024 or Ippolito et al. in 2022. From this, it can be concluded that the use of job postings is a commonly used and proven method to determine the skills expectations of different job roles and industries using frequency measures. Similarly, Agoeng's research conducted extensive salary research in 2024 with a data set and analysis methods consistent with ours. This underlines the significance of the data set and methodology used in this research for answering the research objectives. Lastly, quantitative research is considered generalizable and transferable to other situations, people, settings and measures. (Creswell and Creswell, 2018) This is relevant when it comes to ensuring external validity. However, convenience sampling cannot guarantee the transferability of the results outside the context of that study. (Cook and Campbell, 1979; Hardwicke et al., 2020) 

 

## Limitations 

However, the dataset also has some limitations that restrict its validity. First, we have no evidence that we are interpreting the data duplicates in the salary dataset correctly. The question that arises from this is whether these duplicates result from different salaries/salary variants of the same job or whether the salary offers were compiled from job advertisements. This is important for the frequency and distribution analysis of the salary dataset. Furthermore, we do not know how the original data was collected as the dataset was published by a third party without any information on the methodology/data collection. Therefore, we cannot draw any final conclusions about bias.  

 

## Methodological integrity 

Algorithms and models are selected based on the specific nature of the data and the project objectives, and validation techniques such as cross-validation and training-test-split are performed to check the performance of the models and avoid overfitting.  

 

## Ethical considerations 

## License: 

This dataset is licensed under the Open Data Commons. Users are granted permission to use this data even commercially. 

License version: Database Contents License (DbCL) v1.0. 

URL: https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/dbcl/1-0/ 

Relevant ethical considerations will be taken into account in this analysis to ensure that the research is conducted carefully and in accordance with ethical standards. Privacy protection, transparency and neutrality in data analysis are the aspects of these considerations that will take center stage.  

## Confidentiality and Data Privacy: 

The data set chosen for this analysis contains sensitive salary information. It is not clear whether the salary information originates from public job advertisements or was collected from private individuals. As the dataset does not contain any traceable link to personal data, the former is assumed. This means that no identifiers such as names, addresses or other personal data are known and are not included in the data analysis. This in turn concludes that no individual consent to the use and processing of the data needs to be obtained. 

## Ensuring Neutrality and Fairness: 

The dataset contains data from several countries, with the majority of the data being for the USA. Since the analysis may be biased because some countries are not represented, it was decided to only include data from the US. In addition, the analysis could be biased if the dataset does not represent certain ethnic groups of people, countries, etc. To avoid this, the necessary steps will be taken to identify and report any bias in the dataset. 

## Transparency: 

Finally, transparency in research is crucial. To ensure transparency of analysis and reporting, we will ensure that all limitations and biases are clearly stated, and we will report our findings truthfully and accurately.  

 

# 3. Analysis and Interpretation 

Firstly, we will explore how the data science job market is behaving. In that regard, we follow the guiding question: How do salaries and the relationship between distance and salary behave depending on the job title, the industry and the entry level? 

# 4. Conclusion 

Overall, our results are consistent with what we expected to find. 

The feedback from other peers helped us a lot. With their help, we realized that we used many different colors in different plots. In this final report, we tried to change the colors so that the colors of the same element become consistent, which makes our project easier for everyone to understand.  

In addition, since many peers seem very interested in the entry-level experience in job market, we added a small topic in the analysis of the final report to specifically discuss the entry level. We found that entry-level salaries are much lower than other high-experience levels. Moreover, some positions can only be filled by highly experienced practitioners. We also found that entry-level salaries have dropped a lot in recent years, especially during the pandemic. It is very important to investigate the employment trends at the entry level, because almost all students in our major will enter the data science related job market with experience at the entry level after graduation. Understanding this will be very helpful for us to find jobs in the future. 

In addition, Andy's feedback is also very important to us. We made a lot of pie charts and donut charts at the beginning. Due to Andy's feedback, we decided not to use the above two charts. We replaced all pie charts and donut charts with other plots. We found that other plots are indeed easier for the audience to understand various trends than those two plots. Moreover, Andy pointed out that there are too many boxplots in our previous work, so we also converted some of the boxplots into other better and more appropriate plots. 

Every team member has made a lot of contributions. First of all, our leader Jenny has done a lot for our team. She is very good at writing and making beautiful slides. In the report, she played her expertise and wrote most of the introduction and literature review parts. She is also a very good leader. She is good at organizing all team members and letting everyone do their appropriate work. Pradeepa is a very creative team member. She has made many constructive suggestions for our group. In the data visualization part, she has made many excellent plots. Sai is a very good coder. He sorted and classified our raw data into easier-to-operate data, and classified hundreds of different job titles into five basic categories. When team members have any technical or code problems, he can help everyone very soon, helping everyone find errors and solve them in time. Yanwei is a very hardworking team member. He did a lot of trivial things in this project, such as cleaning data. He make several plots for the entry level after receiving feedback from peers to analyze the entry level job market. And he also played a role in the writing part. 

For next project, if we have the opportunity, our next project could be to investigate and analyze the salaries of data science-related jobs in Canada. Since there is too little data in Canada in our original data, we chose to analyze only the data in America. However, the analysis results of the United States were only for reference for the Canadian job market. If we want to have a deeper understanding of the Canadian job market, we need more Canadian-related data for analysis in future studies. The new guiding questions should be roughly the same as those in our project. The only difference is that we will use these questions for the Canadian market, and the resulting results may be completely different.
